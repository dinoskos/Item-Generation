# Item-Generation
The purpose of this script is to replicate and extend a previous study by Taylor (2016): Modeling Item Difficulty for Perceptual Speed and Accuracy Tests. 
The original study examined participants perception in differentiating between a pair of similar words with a replacement. 
\
For example: *abcde* and *abcdo*. 

Our study tried to further extend the original examining the pairs through Item Response Theory framework to devise Difficulty and Discrimination parameter.
Our study laid the foundation for future item generation study.
